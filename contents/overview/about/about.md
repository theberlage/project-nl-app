title: Project NL River Atlas
---
The River Atlas culminates the current incarnation of the Berlage’s long-standing Project NL course in collaboration with TU Delft’s Department of Academic Heritage and Allmaps. It is an attempt to understand the Dutch river landscapes, not as givens but rather products of complex sets of decisions, negotiations, aspirations, and—at times—arbitrary events. It traces these decisions in relation to broader historical shifts such as the Enlightenment, our subsequent effort to engineer nature, moments of hesitation and gradual aspirations for coexistence. 

 A range of cartographic documents, archival materials and historical records  are used to  document spaces, buildings, infrastructure, landscapes, and how these transformed over time. From the first comprehensive cartographic documentation of the Netherlands' river landscape in the 1830s—led by B. H. Goudriaan—to the late 20th century ‘New Style’ maps, the Dutch River Maps were a primary source of investigation. They were studied through the lens of river dynamics and regulation, trade and transportation, extraction and discharge and inhabitation and recreation. These series consisting of hundreds of maps would inform the trained eye about their historical context, purpose of execution, their patrons and beneficiaries. Following the dawn of enlightened thought this set of documents was the first attempt at measuring, quantifying and assessing the river in order to start planning into the future. With the availability of new digital tools such as Allmaps and Placemark we are able to work with these cartographic documents. Operations that would have taken an unfeasible amount of time and tedious labor such as overlaying, duplicating, masking and juxtaposing these maps in the same physically accurate space are now possible with the help of open-source tools. 

The exhibition layout consists of original prints of the river maps from different periods on one side and speculative histories based on these maps on the other. Seven narratives speculate on how a different set of decisions following a specific pivotal point in history could have crystallized in an entirely different yet probable spatial configuration. They look at themes ranging from settlement patterns to [un]productive landscapes to national and local infrastructures while drawing links between historical tendencies and the current state of the river landscapes. Together with the displayed original maps and the digital application, they constitute a body of work that explores the relationship between developments in cartographic technology and the material culture of archive material, reflecting on shifts in the accessibility, possibilities of processing, and forms of dissemination of cartographic documents.
  
This atlas is in no way comprehensive but as a tool for navigation it give us some clues about the types of challenges we may have to face in the near future, how to identify the complex web of relationships they would be entangled in and the arsenal of tools that may be available to us for acting on them. 

_River Atlas will be exhibited in the Department of Architecture corridor, located on the first floor of the TU Delft’s Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment’s eastern wing, from Tuesday, January 31 to Wednesday, March 1._
