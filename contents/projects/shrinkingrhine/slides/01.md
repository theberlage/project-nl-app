## Rotterdam aan de Rivier

## and the capacity of policy and decision-making processes to respond to longer term, larger scale natural developments

In the early 18th century the Rhine and the IJssel began silting up, making shipping increasingly difficult. The Rhine municipalities saw the solution in the connection to the Waal through the Pannerden canal, Waal municipalities disagreed. 

What if Pannerden canal was never connected to the Rhine as a result of these disputes leading to the gradual decline of the Rhine until it became completely unfit for transport? The contribution speculates on changes in the spatial, economic, social, legislative, and juridical structure of Rotterdam without its port.

In the aftermath of WWll, maritime trade, expansion of the port and the annexation of adjacent municipalities all came to a halt. If the Rhine would have continued to silt up then the city would have been forced to eventually re-envision itself as a post-industrial town with a historic center, an attractive riverfront and prime recreational facilities. With the ever-increasing possibilities for long distance-traveling, the future of Rotterdam would revolve around tourism and service industries. 

Nowadays it is difficult to imagine a “Portless Rotterdam,” however, with worsening climate change the eventual silting of the Rhine becomes credible. The river ecosystems can not keep up with our ever-increasing demands and a different coexistence model is needed. This scenario, -being one of many- is an opportunity for a playful reevaluation of the status quo.
