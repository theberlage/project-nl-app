## Original Construction Plan of de Waalbrug

The middle class in the lower town, especially the shopkeepers, vehemently opposed the landing of the bridge at Belvédère because they knew that the center of the city would shift to the upper town area with the completion of the bridge. This results in the loss of the commercial benefits tied to accessibility.
