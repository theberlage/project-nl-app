##  Terping of the Biesbosch

Similarly to polders, terps were controlled by a combination of government, non-government and private parties, which required a great deal of negotiation. The map distinguishes three agricultural terp-types: organically grown terps dating from the sixteenth century, circle-shape terps from the nineteenth century, and the band-terps. Band-terps grew linearly in size over time. This linear growth was implemented to passively regulate the waterflow in the Biesbosch. With the construction of the nineteenth century terps, Biesbosch became a place of intensive wetland mono-culture.
