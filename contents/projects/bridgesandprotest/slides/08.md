## Quays for Trade and Recreation

The need for dredging the north side of the Waal became more urgent due to the urban development of Lent and the fact that the depth of the Waal on the north side limited the width of the navigation channel. Thus, Lent took advantage of the Third normalization of the Waal (reduction of main-channel width from 310 to 260 m to improve navigability, 1910-1916) to deepen the north side of the Waal. 

With the increased space utilization of the river, the urban functions of the riverbanks on both sides were differentiated: the Lent side had the opportunity to take on trade and logistics functions, while the Nijmegen side had a more purely recreational function. The increased water capacity in the Waal also helped to prevent flooding in Nijmegen to a certain extent.
