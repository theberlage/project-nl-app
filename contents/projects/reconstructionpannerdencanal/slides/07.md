## From Lobith to Nijmegen: Nijmegen

The positioning of Nijmegen as inland trade city, resulted in a large expansion of the port and growth of the city of Nijmegen. The northern part of the city (Lent) gradually developed with harbors, petrochemical clusters for international supply and worker houses. At the same time, the accumulation of resources and opportunities brought by transportation and trade development has attracted more people to gather. Therefore, at the opposite side of the river, the city gradually expanded, with the construction of the residential facilities for the purpose of a livable city. The coordinated development of ports and living conditions has become an important topic for Nijmegen.

Mention: City development, In-land shipping port
