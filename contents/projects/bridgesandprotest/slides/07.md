## City expansion in Lent

With the abandonment of the ferry and the construction of Waalbrug, the accessibility of Lent would be greatly improved for the residents of Nijmegen. A new city center across Nijmegen would be formed between the existing railroad bridge on the west side and Waalbrug. The new port on the Lent side would be built on the site of the existing lake near the dike. Lent is flatter than Nijmegen and has more development potential to take advantage of the transport infrastructure including rail, shipping and roads as well as to build supporting industrial and warehousing facilities. Lent would start large-scale urban development 100 years ahead of schedule.
