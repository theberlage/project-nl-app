## Nuclear for Nature

To amend the environmental impact of the Dodewaard nuclear park, GKN, in cooperation with Rijkswaterstaat, the Province of Gelderland, and construction company Boskalis finalized the renaturalization plan for the Hiensche Waard and proceeded to its implementation. The initiative was integrated in the broader planning for the Afferdense and Deestse Waarden improvement and for the Room for the River project. It was projected to promote the viability of local flora and fauna through a design that remained non-obstructive to the effective operation of the nuclear power plant complex and, after 2008 and 2009, of the on-site interim and permanent radioactive waste storage facilities.
