# **De Rode Week**
### _House of Industry_

At the doors of the Waalhaven sit the Houses of Industry. A multi-programmatic tower, the house of industry can be characterized as a vertical city, translating the relational strategies of the settlement to the scale of the building. Maintaining a horizontal organization, each floor will include several programs like administrative functions, physical activity, industrial production, and intellectual research. Along with the Stam factory, the house of industry characterizes the projected image of collective habitation and production in the socialist port.
