## Waterschappen

## and the mediation of local risk, scales of collectivity, and the allocation of resources for water management


Beginning with the need to protect the  reclaimed land, water boards were established to handle local water management. As some of the oldest democratic institutions in the country, water boards were funded through taxation. The Rijkswaterstaat was established in 1798 to manage water on a national scale. With the creation of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1815, a new democratic monarchy was established. At the time, there was debate between unitarians – who favored a centralized state – and federalists – who preferred regional, or provincial autonomy. 

What if the federalist approach to decentralized water management dominated policy during the establishment of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands? 

Rather than a centralized Rijkswaterstaat, all water management would be overseen by local and regional water boards. Each water board would be tasked with balancing local conditions, risk management, and finances. 

In the contribution’s comparison of the decentralized water boards, the unique challenges and subsequent responses reveal the influence of virtual policies on physical development patterns. Within a decentralized system, development patterns may shift away from the river, bankruptcy looms a threat to many, flood risk remains constant, and the river’s edge could be dramatically different.
