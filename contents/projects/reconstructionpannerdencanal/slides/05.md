### _ii.    Bifurcation Technology_

The technology that was presented made use of groynes, often used to navigate the river. A redevelopment of the technology, proposed a bifurcation technology which upscaled the conventionally applied groyne.  
A revolutionary technology, while still with risks, but, due to the urgent challenges faced, was constructed for the first time. The precise development of the technology could result in a reconsideration of the water distribution on a larger scale.
After depicting a location downstream Nijmegen, the morphological positioning of the new canal and bifurcation, resulted in the specified site near Oosterhout. Where, the bifurcation point of the Oosterhout Canal was set at an angle of 40% distribution of the Rhine water to the Oosterhout Canal, and 60% in the Waal. A deviation from the original distribution/distribution of 30%/70%, set to connect Pannerden with Arnhem.
