## From Lobith to Nijmegen

The positioning of Nijmegen as an inland trade city resulted in the exponential expansion of the port and the abiding growth of the city of Nijmegen. 
With the accumulation of resources and opportunities brought by the development of trade and transportation, Nijmegenâ€™s population grew and the city gradually expanded outside its historic city center. While more public infrastructure projects were constructed, recreational transport on the water increased.

Simultaneously, on the opposite side of the river, near Lent, the city of Nijmegen developed its harbor as a new global hub for both national and international trade. Through the construction of new ports and the development of worker houses, Nijmegen planned for further growth.
