## Terps and River

The Biesbosch was an area with a tidal difference up to two meters, which is significantly higher than most of the river landscape at the time. Terps allowed tidal movements, preventing excessive sedimentation, and removing water pollution. The flood protection relied on elevated land as well as giving the river more room thus preventing dangerous water levels.
