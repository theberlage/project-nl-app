## Wijngaarden Water Board - 1961

Wijngaarden sustained minimal damage in the 1953 flood. However, with the abandonment of nearby water boards, the water board decided to increase spending on flood prevention to protect its booming population. The water board also had to deal with a new challenge: sinking polders. Construction and infrastructure projects continued to remove groundwater from the polders, slowly lowering the ground level. The water board began to plan infrastructure projects and dike improvements to combat these new challenges.
