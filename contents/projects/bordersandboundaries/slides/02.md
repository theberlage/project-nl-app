## Wijngaarden Water Board - 1881

Wijngaarden, a water board named after one of the polders inside its boundaries, sits inland of the river. This sheltered polder had lower taxes for water management and flood defense projects. With no extra costs for flood protection, the water board entered into an agreement with the National Rail Company for a train station within its borders, with a direct connection to Dordrecht.  Although Dordrecht had jobs, it also had a high cost of living due to the necessary flood protection measures.
