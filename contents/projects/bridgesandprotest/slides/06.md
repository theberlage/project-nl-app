## Waalkade-Nijmegen Quay

Waalkade is kept alive. The tradition of the market in front of the stores on the Nijmegen riverbank is continued. The historical sailing club in the bay near Belvédère is retained with the transfer of the bridge pier construction. The floating baths that began to appear in Nijmegen after the 19th century can escape the fate of closing down in the future. Thus, Nijmegen has luxurious palatial floating baths similar to those in Rotterdam
