## Flood Management

At Nijmegen, the Waal bends sharply to the west, hugging the city and forming a bottleneck in the river. Historically Nijmegen has experienced many floods, including the flood of 1920, when the bar in the cafe along the river was about to be submerged. The last major floods of the city in 1993 and 1995 resulted in the action of Dutch Government, the municipality and other stakeholders that created more room for the river, whilst safeguarding the city inhabitants.
