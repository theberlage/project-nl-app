## Wetland-based Agricultural Systems

Terp-settlements had a center and two rings. The center and the first ring form a dry plateau. As the second ring is not heightened, it is covered by marshland and water. The center, being the highest point, as the center of distribution and organization was the public space where all the plots adjoined. Often, a church can be found there or a water well. A single road would connect the terp with the river. The first ring is radially divided into plots of arable heightened land. The center and the first ring form a dry plateau. The second ring is not heightened, so farmers adapt their activities to the marshland and water found in these rings.
