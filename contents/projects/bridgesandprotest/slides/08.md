## Quays for Trade and Recreation

The need for dredging the north side of the Waal becomes more urgent due to the urban development of Lent and the fact that the depth of the Waal on the north side limits the width of the navigation channel. Thus, Lent takes advantage of Third normalization of the Waal (reduction of main-channel width from 310 to 260 m to improve navigability, 1910-1916) to deepen the north side of the Waal. 

With the increased space utilization of the river, the urban functions of the river banks on both sides are differentiated: Lent side has the opportunity to take on trade and logistics functions, while Nijmegen side has a more purely recreational function. The increased water capacity in the Waal also helps to prevent flooding in Nijmegen to a certain extent.
