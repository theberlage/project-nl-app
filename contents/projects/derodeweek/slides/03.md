## Competition for an Industrial Settlement

By 1928 the competition gains international traction, presenting the opportunity for a new urban model. Confronting a paternalistic relationship between the workers and individual industries, as exemplified by the housing development of Heijplaat, the first prize of the competition was led by Soviet architect Ivan Leonidov and Dutch architect Mart Stam. Their proposal defined three clear districts parallel to the river, the industrial zone, the green buffer, and the residential zone, with the settlement being characterized by its lifestyle and working functions.
