### _vi. Traditional Crafter Terps_

We imagine these little settlements to construct or enlarge mounds and  constitute a web of small-scale terps (height 3m, diameter 10m), which remained small as they served only as a place for shelter since the low lying and wet environment of marshlands generated the income.
