## 1936 River Maps

The development of the Waalhaven did not take the same form as the contribution presented. Instead, the ship port grew in increments with more and more individual companies occupying its branches. The two-storey collective houses, with their carefully designed brick facades, became shells for single-family homes, while the taller ones were eventually occupied as offices by independent companies. The Rode Week was not successful, the settlement for shipbuilders was not commissioned, and the Waalhaven did not serve as a model for the industrial settlements of the Dutch river landscape.
