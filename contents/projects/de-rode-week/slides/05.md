# *A New Approach to Housing*
## _The Living Strip_

The ‘living and recreational’ zone comprises three strips, dividing housing and public facilities such as medical centers, sporting facilities, and other social infrastructure. With an open linear layout, the settlement rejects centrality and instead builds relative interdependence between housing, industry, leisure, and transportation.
