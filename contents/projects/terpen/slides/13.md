## Flood protection

But what about floods? During the 1953 flood the water went up to 3,85 meters above NAP. The highest terp found in the real world was 8,8 meters above NAP. In mind that this dated to the 9th century, we could speculate on the nineteenth century terps to have a height of 10 meters.
