## Title

During the interwar period Rotterdam did become an attractive tourist destination however not as successful as John Wytema envisioned and with the start of WWll all business came to a halt. Unlike Amsterdam that was a key strategic port, Rotterdam concluded the war without any major damage. However additional measures had to be taken in order to ensure the necessary investments for the city as well as boosting the post-war morale.  In a moment of heightened cultural exchange between Netherlands and the US the Coney Island precedent was suggested. It was to be the first of its kind ensuring the necessary touristic flow as well as heightening the spirits of local residents.  The decision becomes to find a new use for Noordeisland - by now completely abandoned island with a lush flora and fauna. First iterations were made by ***  but were turned down due to “incompatibleness to the local landscape.” The early sketches that were approved came from Anton Pieck.
