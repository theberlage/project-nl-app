## Notion of Terps

It is hard to imagine the Netherlands without dikes. However, before they were implemented throughout the country, there was a time when the inhabitants of this territory had to find other ways to protect themselves from the water. Since 500 BC, especially in the northern region of Friesland, people lived on terpsâ€”artificially raised mounds to dwell and farm on, composed of locally found materials, offering protection through height. By 1200, the practicality of dikes replaced the more laborious construction of terps. Dikes kept large tracts of land dry with much less effort, but they proved to have their flaws as well.
