## Heated River

Despite implemented improvements in the cooling water processing systems, the median water temperature in the Hiensche floodplain rose by 1.5°C since 1982, while maximums of 30°C degrees were observed in the mean temperature of the Waal’s main body. On shallower reaches the year-round median water temperature was 3°C higher than in 1982.
