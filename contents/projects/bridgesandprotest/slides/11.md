## A Revised River Management Plan

Before the Room for the River program was adopted, the Calamity Polder plan was seen as a competing option. The plan is to use polder fields upstream of important economic areas as emergency reservoirs, including the Ooijpolder upstream of Nijmegen, and to evacuate the residents of the polder fields in advance to reduce larger losses. After the Nijmegen urban plan was changed with Waalbrug, a partial disaster polder scheme would be implemented. the connection point between Het Meer and Waal would be widened so that when the water level was higher than the threshold between Ooijpolder and Waal, the flood water would enter Ooijpolder in the opposite direction, which will reduce the flood peak through Nijmegen.
