## Introduction of the Steam dredger and the Excavation of the Nieuwe Merwede

A second condition to speculate on the flourishing of a large-scale mound construction is the introduction of the steam dredger in 1824, which allowed for the excavation of the Nieuwe Merwede canal between 1861 and 1874. Building on this, a third altering of facts is introduced: private investors negotiated with the government to use the soil dredged from the Nieuwe Merwede to construct terps. After completion, investors resell the land in parcels to individual farmers. In some cases, terps were named after their benefactors.
