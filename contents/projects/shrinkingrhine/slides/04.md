## Travel for Leisure

By the turn of the century a new mayor is elected. John Wytema decides that his administration will do what his predecessors couldn’t do: redefine the future of Rotterdam, a future without the port and its industries. In search for a new long term economic driver the city decided to take advantage of Rotterdam’s existing railroad infrastructure but this time not for goods but for passengers. This was the time when international railroad travels for leisure were becoming more popular and the newly emerging middle class was demanding ever more options for spare time activities. Recreation and tourism were to become the main development vectors for the decades to come.
