## The New Fairytale is Born

During the interwar period Rotterdam did become an attractive tourist destination however not as successful as John Wytema envisioned and with the start of WWll all business came to a halt. Unlike Amsterdam, which was a key strategic port, Rotterdam concluded the war without any major damage. However additional measures had to be taken in order to ensure the necessary investments for the city as well as boosting the post-war morale.  In a moment of heightened cultural exchange between the Netherlands and the United States of America the Coney Island precedent was suggested. It was to be the first of its kind in Europe ensuring the necessary touristic flow as well as heightening the spirits of local residents.  The decision was made to find a new use for Noordereiland—by now a completely abandoned island with lush flora and fauna. First iterations were made by Crown American  —an investment group from Pennsylvania—   but were turned down due to “incompatibleness to the local landscape.” The early sketches that were approved came from Anton Pieck—by then a well-known illustrator of fairy tale books.
