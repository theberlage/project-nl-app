## Wetland-based agricultural systems

The first ring, higher and protected against the river, was used for smaller scale productions of crops and cattle breeds, and also served as a storage place of the extracted sources of the second ring. If the second ring was marshland, then reed, rushes or willows were cultivated on a large scale. If the second ring was filled with water, it was used for fish farming.
