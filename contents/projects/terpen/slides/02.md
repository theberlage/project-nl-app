## Notion of Terps

It is hard to imagine the Netherlands without dikes. But of course, as all things have a beginning, so did the dikes, and there was a time where the Dutch needed to find another way of protecting themselves from the water. Between 500 BC and the ninth century, people lived on terps â€”artificially raised ground, mounds to dwell on, offering protection through height. In 1200, terps slowly vanished from the foreground because of the arrival of the dikes, which proved to have their flaws as well.
