### _i.    Construction of the (Pannerden) Canal at Oosterhout_

In 1672 the French were not able to wade over the canal during war, due to a change of weather conditions, after which a sense of vulnerability remained. The incessant period of hydrological uncertainties was claimed to come to an end when a new technological solution was presented; a canal and bifurcation point enabling the controlled distribution of water. 
Thorough discussions with water hydrologists, water boards, military, and all major trade towns, ultimately resulted in the construction of a canal next to Oosterhout, downstream of Nijmegen, in 1798. A position that enabled the split of the Rhine close to the German land border, would provide the Neder Rhine and Lek with a regulated amount of water; while stimulating the inland export reciprocally, between East and West.
