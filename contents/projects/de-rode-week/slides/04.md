# *A New Approach to Housing*
## _Rejecting Spangen Housing Block_

Leonidov takes a clear approach to reject local urban housing models such as Heijplaat and Spangen which focus on a centralized development around a central point. Instead, the open plain of housing and recreational space provides a horizontal expansion. The square serves as the geometrical and organizing principle for the city from the scale of the block to that of the room.
