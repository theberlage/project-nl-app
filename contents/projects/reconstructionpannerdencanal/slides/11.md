## Alternative River System

For the consolidation of the water distribution and further improvement of the trade and transportation network, in 1920, the municipality decided to construct a canal on the west of Nijmegen: the Maas-Waal Canal. Enabling the connection of the Maas and Waal, and consecutively, through its connection with the Oosterhout Canal, with the Neder-Rhine and IJssel. 

The reconfiguration of the rivers, together with the changed water distribution, would increase the amount of water flowing from the Rhine to the IJsselmeer, enhancing the supply of the IJsselmeerâ€™s freshwater basin, which in reality is facing great consequences of saltwater intrusion.

Could an alternative water system be proposed which supports the urban growth towards the East of the Netherlands? Or wherein a synergized water system integrates all river deltas and supplies the Dutch drinking water basin?
