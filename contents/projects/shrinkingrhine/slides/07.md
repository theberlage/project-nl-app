## Grand Opening of the Fairytale Forest

The grand opening of the Noordereiland Fairytale Forest takes place on May 31st 1952. The poster was designed by Anton Pieck. The banner title—Fairytale Forest—was the island’s main protagonist. It was rooted in the island’s industrial past, well-preserved vegetation as well as Anton’s childhood memories of Den Helder.
