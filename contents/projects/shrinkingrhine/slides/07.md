## Grand Opening of the Fairytale Forest

The grand opening of the Noordereiland Efteling of the Fairytale Forest on 31 May 1952. The poster was designed by a well-known illustrator of fairy tale books and the most influential park creator, Anton Pieck. The banner title, Fairytale Forest, was the park’s main attraction then. It is rooted in the island’s well-preserved vegetation and semi-artificial existing condition.
