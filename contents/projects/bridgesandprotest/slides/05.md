## Shopkeeperâ€™s Proposal

If the landing point of the bridge was placed in Ganzenheuvel (lower town), as proposed by the shopkeepers. The bridge would be connected to a section of underground tunnel, taking into account the overall interest of the entire Nijmegen old town and the lower city. The arch bridge would be connected to the landing point by a ramp, and the space under the ramp would be used as a parking lot. Given the height difference between the landing site and the pier, a roadway loop would be constructed to connect the landing site, the parking lot and the roadway near the quay, and a pedestrian bridge would be constructed to connect the bridge directly to the quay. These ancillary infrastructures attached to the bridge would be built to maximise the possibility for pedestrians or vehicles to pass through and stay in the lower city.
