## Shopkeeperâ€™s Proposal

The landing point of the bridge is placed in Ganzenheuvel (lower town), as proposed by the shopkeepers. The bridge is connected to a section of an underground tunnel, taking into account the aspect of managing traffic in Nijmegen. The arch bridge is connected to the landing point by a ramp, and the space under the ramp is used as a parking lot. Given the height difference between the landing site and the pier, a roadway loop is constructed to connect the landing site, the parking lot and the roadway near the quay, and a pedestrian bridge is constructed to connect the bridge directly to the quay. These ancillary infrastructures attached to the bridge are built to maximize the possibility for pedestrians or vehicles to pass through and stay in the lower city.
