## In Reality

Natural gas was discovered in Groningen in 1959 and a competitive nuclear energy strategy in the Netherlands was no longer appealing. GKN’s first and only nuclear power plant in the Hiensche floodplain was decommissioned prematurely in 1997, due to local opposition, stemming from environmental and safety concerns, intensely expressed through protests in the 1980s. In 2003, the power plant started its 40-year-safe-containment waiting period. Total demolition will take place after the passing of an agreed radioactivity half-life waiting period passes. The Hiensche floodplain was part of the broader area’s Room for the River Project in 2006, yet no other significant landscape or river management interventions transformed its current state.
