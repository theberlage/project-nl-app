## The Dike Set back

In order to prevent flooding of urban areas, the Dutch government is promoting a policy of widening flood plains of larger rivers, rather than raising the dikes, which is a departure from the traditional Dutch approach to flood protection.

Room for the river Waal along Nijmegen is one of the earliest and completed projects (2012-2016). In the case of Nijmegen this involved moving the Waal dike in Lent (northern part of the city) and constructing an ancillary channel in the flood plains, the so called Spiegelwaal (Mirror Waal).

But in the context of this fictional “Waalbrug” scenario, the relocation of the dike in Lent would not be possible. Another alternative plan which was considered by the government after 1995 flood would be implemented.
