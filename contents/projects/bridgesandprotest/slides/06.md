## Waalkade-Nijmegen Quay

Waalkade was kept alive and the tradition of the market in front of the stores on the Nijmegen riverbank continued. The historical sailing club in the bay near Belvédère was retained with the transfer of the bridge pier construction. The floating baths that began to appear in Nijmegen after the nineteenth century could escape closure. Thus, Nijmegen had luxurious palatial floating baths similar to those in Rotterdam.
