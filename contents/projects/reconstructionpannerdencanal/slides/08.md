## From Lobith to Nijmegen

The location of the bifurcation point resulted in plans to standardize the river, for it to enable the continuous and steady flow of water at the site of the bifurcation. To reduce impact within the Rhine River area, the standardization was done predominantly within the existing summerbed, minimizing the relocation of existing, urban settlements. This resulted in a revision of the primary water defense line, and the construction of new summer dikes. Consequently, the standardized river facilitated enough space for the growing demand of shipments and increasing size of ships, which after the standardization of the Rhine until Nijmegen, would be planned and executed for the full stretch of the river.
