# *A New Approach to Housing*
## _Rejecting Spangen Housing Block_

Leonidov takes a clear approach to reject local urban housing models such as Heijplaat and Spangen which focus on a centralized development around a central point. Instead, the open plain of housing and recreational space provides a horizontal expansion. The square serves as the geometrical and organizing principle for the city from the scale of the block to that of the room.

The ‘living and recreational’ zone comprises three strips, dividing housing and public facilities such as medical centers, sporting facilities, and other social infrastructure. With an open linear layout, the settlement rejects centrality and instead builds relative interdependence between housing, industry, leisure, and transportation.
