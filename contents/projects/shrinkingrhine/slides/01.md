## Rotterdam aan de Rivier

and the capacity of policy and decision-making processes to respond to longer term, larger scale natural developments

In the early 18th century the Rhine and the IJssel began silting up, making shipping increasingly difficult. The Rhine municipalities saw the solution in the connection to the Waal through the Pannerden canal, Waal municipalities disagreed. 

What if Pannerden canal was never connected to the Rhine as a result of these disputes leading to the gradual decline of the Rhine until it became completely unfit for transport? The contribution speculates on changes in the spatial, economic, social, legislative, and juridical structure of Rotterdam without its port.
