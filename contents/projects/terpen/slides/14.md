## River Map Giessendam, no. 14. First Revision, series I, 1877

Terps did not happen in the Biesbosch. Instead, due to the growing land accretion, more and more polders were constructed turning the Biesbosch into a puzzle of little polders. In the 1970s, with the construction of a band dike, land consolidation took place, turning the Biesbosch into one big polder. In 2015, with the Room for the River project, the Biesbosch was depoldered, introducing a more flexible regulation of the water level.
