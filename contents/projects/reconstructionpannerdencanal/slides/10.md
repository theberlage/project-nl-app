## Inland Shipping Capital

The contribution provides insight for reflection, as the alternative location of the bifurcation point near Nijmegen could have led to an alternative city development within the Netherlands. With the triangular organization of ports (Amsterdam, Nijmegen, Rotterdam) the inland and outbound shipment ports could have been evenly spread over the Netherlands, complementing each other economically. 

Instead of major city developments only happening at the edge of the Netherlands near the sea, resulting in the Randstad, the triangular trade network would have resulted in a more even distribution of cities within the Netherlands. Potentially, the main citiesâ€™ configuration would have become horizontally spread, establishing a Bandstad from east to west as a axis supplying north and south. 

Would an alternative city and port development have resulted in different terms and challenges towards the subsidence of land and rise of river and sea water level?
