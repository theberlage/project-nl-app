## Traditional Crafter Terps

Little settlements construct or enlarge mounds and constitute a web of small-scale terps (three meters tall and ten meters in diameter) . As the surrounding low lying and wet marshland was desirable and generated income, each remained small as they served only as a place for shelter.In the beginning of the 17th century, the Netherlands accumulated a lot of wealth with a flourishing trade network. Rich individuals, like Bisschops and business people, wanted to invest in infrastructural undertakings which led to the phenomenon of draining large-scale lakes in the Netherlands. Regardless, technological advances were not yet on point to make an enterprise of mound construction profitable. And so it would be another century before mound construction really took off.
