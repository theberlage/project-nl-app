## Lekkerland Water Board - 1921

Lekkerlandâ€™s population remained small through the turn of the twentieth century.  Due to flood dangers and lack of financial resources, the water board was forced to accept life with a higher risk of flooding. Maintaining its agricultural focus, land values began to decline as dikes began to show weaknesses.
