### _viii.    2012 Renaturalization Plan - GKN for Nature_

To amend the environmental impact of the Dodewaard nuclear park, GKN, in cooperation with Rijkswaterstraat, the Municipalities of Nijmegen and Arnhem, and the Boskallis construction company would finalize a renaturalization plan for the Hiensche floodplain and proceed to its implementation. The intervention would be projected to promote the viability of local flora and fauna through a design that would remain non-obstructive to the effective operation of the nuclear power plant complex and, since 2008 and 2009, of the on-site interim and permanent radioactive waste storage facilities.
