##  The Inland Sea

The area of the Biesbosch experienced the vulnerabilities of dikes. After a sequence of three devastating floods (1421–1424), including the famous St. Elisabeth flood, there was no money left to repair the band dikes of the “Groote Waard”. Without dike upkeep, the newly formed inland sea called “The Bergsche Veld”, remained uninhabited for more than a century. Nonetheless, the area played a navigational role for shippers in bypassing Dordrecht. To avoid the stapelrecht required by Dordrecht, which meant that every ship passing through needed to stop in the city and publicly offer all their goods for sale, the shippers heading for Antwerp sailed through the small creeks (killen) near the village of Werkendam. Simultaneously, the natural process of soil sedimentation and consolidation by rushes caused marshland to slowly emerge again.
