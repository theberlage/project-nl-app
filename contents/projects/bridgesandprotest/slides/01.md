## De Waalbrug 
on the effects of local protest informing the planning of infrastructure

For centuries, the lower town was the focal point of Nijmegen's economy. Owing to the increased traffic on the Waal, the municipality initiated the construction of the bridge from east of Lent to Belvédère (upper town) in 1911. This plan to build a road bridge on the edge of the city of Nijmegen offered greater spatial flexibility in transport planning on a national level. Even though shopkeepers of the lower town disagreed and protested against this location as it would negatively affect their business their efforts would prove to be only a delay in the implementation of the plan, which was completed in 1936 with support from the Ministry of Water Management.

What if the protests succeeded and the bridge was built and ended at Ganzenheuvel (lower town) as the shopkeepers proposed before Het Rijkswegenplan 1927 (National Road Program) was passed? The contribution speculates on how this would have changed the inner city and the development of Nijmegen as a whole.

With bridge landings in proximity to the quays, Nijmegen’s riverbanks would have been preserved as a center for trade and recreation. Instead of growing to the south, the city would have focused expansion on the infrastructural axis around the old village of Lent. With two densely built river fronts, the Room for the River project in 2012 would have found a different location.

The contribution highlights the tension between local interests and infrastructure planning, projecting potential large-scale and long-term effects of local alterations.
