### _iv.    Cooling Water Discharge_

The heated (to a legal maximum of 30Â°C) cooling water is discharged through a water outlet to the Strang. For Dodewaard II and III supplementary cooling towers are needed.
Dodewaard II uses a series of crossflow cooling towers, and dissipates the heat into the atmosphere.
Dodewaard III uses a natural draft hyperbolic cooling tower. The hyperboloid shape aids in accelerating the upward convective air flow, improving cooling efficiency.
