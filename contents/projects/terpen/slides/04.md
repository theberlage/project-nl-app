## First Terp

A narrow stretch of islands separated the Merwede River from the inland sea, and on one of them, a “survivor” of the ravaging flood is found. Building on this, a first altering of events is speculated: the remaining house, mentioned in a 1523 report to be an inn, became a mooring point for shippers that searched neutral ground to dock. The natural platform in which it was built was enlarged in its perimeter to create more living space, leading to the consolidation of the first terp in the area.
