## First Sign of Life

On a 16th century map, on a small remaining island north of the Groote Waard (Sliedrechtse Biesbosch), a ‘survivor’ of the devastating 1421 St. Elizabeth flood is found. The only sign of human life in the newly formed inland sea, dating from 1523. At the same time, Dordrecht was pushing for the ‘stapelrecht’ at the address of CharlesV, which simply meant that every ship that would pass Dordrecht needed to stop there and publicly offer all their goods, which caused a bothersome delay for the shippers. So the annoyed shippers that were heading for Antwerp bypassed Dordrecht by sailing through these ‘killen’ (small rivers) near to the village Werkendam.
