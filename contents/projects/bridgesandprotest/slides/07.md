## City expansion in Lent

With the abandonment of the ferry and the construction of the Waalbrug, the accessibility of Lent greatly improved for the residents of Nijmegen. A new city center across Nijmegen was formed between the existing railroad bridge on the west side and the Waalbrug. The new port on the Lent side was built on the site of the existing lake near the dike. Lent was flatter than Nijmegen and had more development potential taking advantage of the transport infrastructure including rail, shipping and roads as well as supporting industrial and warehousing facilities. Lent started large-scale urban development 100 years ahead of schedule.
