### _i. Notion of Terps_

It is hard to imagine the Netherlands without dikes. But of course, as all things have a beginning, so did the dikes, and there was a time where the Dutch needed to find another way of dealing with the water, protect themselves against it. This brings us to the 9th century. Before the 9th century, down to 500 BC, people lived on terps, that is, artificially raised ground, mounds to dwell on, which kept you dry by its height. In 1200, terps slowly vanished from the foreground for the arrival of the dikes. Yet throughout history, dikes have shown to have their flaws as well. And so, with the challenges ahead, why not examine other ways of living with the water, and why not re-examine the potential or nonsense of terps?
