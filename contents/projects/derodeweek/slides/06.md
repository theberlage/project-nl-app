## Industry

The machine factory, a key contribution from architect Mart Stam, became a beacon of industry and linked the ship harbor to the train station. Using the latest technologies, its design stemed from the Van Nelle Fabriek Stam completed with Leendert van der Vlugt design several years prior.

The shipbuilding port would extend on two wings from the primary factory with drydocks, warehouses, various material parts factories and assembly stations. Designed to accommodate a maximum ship length of 175 meters, the industrial port would become the largest shipbuilding harbor in Rotterdam. From the main artery, auxiliary transportation lines circulated from the housing settlement, through the green buffer zone, to the industrial zone, infrastructural zone and finally the house of industry.
