## River Map Series

In 1838, when chief engineer P. Caland was commissioned the First Revision of the River Maps, the relocated bifurcation would result in an alternative sheet index of the series: a representation of the reconsidered morphology of the river with surrounding dikes and important cities alongside the river. The Neder Rhine would be represented as smooth and continuous Rhine branch, by use of the Oosterhout Canal.
