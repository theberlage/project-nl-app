## One Floodplain Powers The Nation

In 2004, the fourth and last power plant on the floodplain was commissioned. Its construction is a close collaboration with PreussenElektra GmbH, and shared model with Isar II Power Plant in Germany. The combined production of Dodewaard II, III& IV, GKN could generate 4000 MW in its peak capacity, and contributed to over 65% of the energy production in the Netherlands.
A brochure informing the public of the power plants was published. In response to the public's concern with the power plantsâ€™ effect on Maas, detailing hydraulic engineering of the river were included.
