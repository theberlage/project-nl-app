### _Competition for an Industrial Settlement_

In 1928, RAA in cooperation with Rotterdamsche Droogdok Maatschappij –RDM- announced a national architecture competition for “The Industrial Settlement of Shipbuilders”, a new district for housing and production in the Waalhaven. The settlement was to house 500-1000 people, including necessary infrastructure for the workers, establishing a framework for an industrial generation. The competition gains international traction, presenting the opportunity for a new urban model. Confronting a paternalistic relationship between the workers and separate industries (prominent in the housing development of Heijplaat), the first prize of the competition was led by Soviet architect Ivan Leonidov and Dutch architect Mart Stam. Their proposal defined three clear districts parallel to the river, the industrial zone, the green buffer, and the residential zone. The settlement was characterized by its lifestyle and working functions.
