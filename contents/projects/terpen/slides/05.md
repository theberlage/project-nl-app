## Emerging Traditional Crafts

To go back to the real world: starting in the sixteenth century and peaking in the seventeenth century, regional trades and crafts developed and prospered, taking advantage of the estuary nature of the Biesbosch. Willow, reed, and rush cultivation, as well as fishing, and duck catching characterized the area for a long time. Two types of people inhabited the wilderness of the Biesbosch. Wandering families sought a new fate in the Biesbosch and established isolated settlements in its marshlands on small mounds, building mostly duck-catching pipes (vangpijpen). Seasonal workers from nearby villages stayed in wooden huts (schrankketen) in deplorable conditions, cutting the reeds, rushes, and pollarding willows.
