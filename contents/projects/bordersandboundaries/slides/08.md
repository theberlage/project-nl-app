## The End of Lekkerland

The Alblasserwaard region was devastated by the 1953 flood. Due to poor dike maintenance, some water boards, including Lekkerland Water board, were completely flooded. These water boards could not afford repairs and decided to abandon their land. Over time, the river began to claim and naturalize this land.
