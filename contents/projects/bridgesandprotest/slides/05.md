## Waalkade-Nijmegen Quay

Waalkade would be kept alive. The tradition of the market in front of the stores on the Nijmegen riverbank would be continued. The historical sailing club in the bay near Belvédère would be retained with the transfer of the bridge pier construction. The floating baths that began to appear in Nijmegen after the 19th century would escape the fate of closing down in the 1950s and being sold at a bargain price with the decline of lower towns. There would even be more luxurious palatial floating baths similar to those in Rotterdam.
