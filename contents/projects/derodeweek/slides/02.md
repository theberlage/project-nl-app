## A New Port

In 1928, the RAA (Rotterdam Architecture Association) in cooperation with Rotterdamsche Droogdok Maatschappij –RDM- announced a national architecture competition for “The Industrial Settlement of Shipbuilders”, a new district for housing and production in the Waalhaven. The settlement was to house 3000 people, including necessary infrastructure for the workers, establishing a framework for an industrial generation.
