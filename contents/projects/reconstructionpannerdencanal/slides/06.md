## From Lobith to Nijmegen

The bifurcation point of the Oosterhout Canal was set at an angle to distribute 40 percent of the Rhine water to the Oosterhout Canal and 60 percent to the Waal—a deviation from the original distribution of 30 and 70 percent between Rhine and Waal respectively. 

With this bifurcation, a triangular network of trade was established that created a direct trade route from Nijmegen to the capital city of Amsterdam, while maintaining the city’s connection with the port of Rotterdam. 

The improved operation of the transportation and trade network enabled Nijmegen, as the largest city upstream of the Rhine, to take on the task of inland transport, transshipment, and storage, making the city a leader the distribution of goods on regional, national, and international levels.
