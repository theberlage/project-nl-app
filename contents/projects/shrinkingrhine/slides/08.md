##  Theme Park Guide Map

After the launch in 1952, the park soon became an essential source of employment for the municipality, and the local middle class benefited considerably from the newly created service industry. After only three years they welcomed their millionth visitor. The adventure park was lightheartedly designed around the thematics of the old port with attractions such as the Pirate ship (Ride), Long Neck (Tower), and Bolbaak (Ferris Wheels). Enjoying the simulacras of the old port people seemed to at once remember the glorious past of Rotterdam and look towards bright post-war future.
