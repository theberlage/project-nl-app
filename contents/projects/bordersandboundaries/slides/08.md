## Wijngaarden Water Board

After the Second Industrial Revolution, inland railway lines became an important means of transportation for the Netherlands. Development in the water board received another boost from the housing boom after the second world war.

With population increasing, the water board decided to raise taxes and begin strengthening their own dikes.
