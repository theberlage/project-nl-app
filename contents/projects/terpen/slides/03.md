##  The Inland Sea

The Biesbosch experienced the disadvantages of dikes. After a sequence of three floods (1421-1424), including the famous St. Elizabeth flood, no money remained to repair the band dikes of the “Grote Waard”. Without dike upkeep, an inland sea formed, called “The Bergsche Veld'' at the time. Little by little, sedimentation of soil and consolidation by rushes caused marshland to emerge again. At the same time, Dordrecht was pushing for the “stapelrecht” at the address of Charles V, which meant that every ship passing through needed to stop in Dordrecht and publicly offer all their goods, which caused a bothersome delay for the shippers. So the annoyed shippers that were heading for Antwerp bypassed Dordrecht by sailing through the killen (small rivers) near the village of Werkendam.
