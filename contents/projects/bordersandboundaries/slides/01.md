## Waterschappen - on the mediation of local risk, scales of collectivity, and the allocation of resources for water management

Following the need to protect reclaimed land, the first water boards were established in the twelfth century to handle local water management. As institutions they were funded through taxation. The Rijkswaterstaat was established in 1798 to manage water on a national scale. With the creation of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1815, a new democratic monarchy was established. At the time, there was debate between unitarians – who favored a centralized state—and federalists—who preferred regional, or provincial autonomy.

What if the federalist approach to decentralized water management dominated policy during the establishment of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands? What if rather than a centralized Rijkswaterstaat, all water management would be overseen by local and regional water boards, each tasked with balancing local conditions, risk management, and finances?

The contribution compares two decentralized water boards: one bordering the river, one surrounded by other water boards. Baring the burden of financing one’s own protection, inhabitation of flood prone areas would have not been feasible, and development patterns would have shifted away from the river.

On the scale of a historical water board—the size of one polder—the contribution addresses the paradox of investing in the protection of increasingly vulnerable areas, and the shift that may occur when the population and related tax income are reducing.
