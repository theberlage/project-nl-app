## Wetland-based Agricultural Systems

Terp-settlements had a center and two rings. The center and the first ring formed a dry plateau. The center was the public space where all the plots adjoined and served as a place for distribution and organization. Often, a church or a water well was found there. The first ring was radially divided into plots of arable heightened land. The second ring was not heightened and is covered by marshland or water. A single road connected the terp with the river.
