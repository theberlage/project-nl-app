## Notion of Terps

As more and more land started to appear and the Biesbosch became an ‘inland estuary’, regional crafts were developed, starting from the 16th century and reaching a peak in the 17th century. These region-specific crafts would characterize the area for long after. Such crafts were duck-catching, willow-, reed- and rush-cultivation and fishing. Two kinds of people were habiting the pristine nature of the Biesbosch. On the one hand wandering families that sought a new fate in the Biesbosch and established isolated settlements in its marshlands on small mounds, constructing duck pipes. And on the other hand temporary residing men from nearby villages like Werkendam which stayed in wooden cabins (schrankketen) in appalling conditions, cutting the reeds, rushes and pollarding the willows.

_Groote Ward, 1625 - 1747_
