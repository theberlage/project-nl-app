## Cooling Water Discharge

The heated (to a legal maximum of 30Â°C) cooling water is discharged through a water outlet to the Strang. For Dodewaard II and III supplementary cooling towers are needed.

Dodewaard II uses a series of crossflow cooling towers, and dissipates the heat into the atmosphere.
