### _Introduction_

In the seventeenth century, the Rhine river delta faced difficulties regulating the water distribution, which became a weakness in the Dutch’ military defense strategy during the Dutch-Franco War (1672). The solution that was provided, the construction of a canal near Pannerden, was aimed specifically to improve the water distribution to enhance military strength. Due to hydrological issues, a regulated bifurcation point (⅓/⅔) was required, which since 1798, has become the main determinator of the Dutch’ water regulation strategy/system. 
The following scenario proposes an alternative development of the Rhine river area, which improved the rivers’ morphology, but took into consideration all aspects of military defense, trade, water regulation.
