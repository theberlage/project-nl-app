## Introduction

Much of the Netherlands would not exist without water management. Local water boards were established to handle local problems. Beginning with the protection of reclaimed land, water boards aimed to keep feet dry. As some of the first democratic institutions in the country, water boards consist of elected positions and are funded through taxation. In addition to water boards the Rijkswaterstaat manages water on a national scale, including flood defenses and water quality.

With the creation of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1815, a new democratic monarchy was established. At the time, there was debate between unitarians – who favored a centralized state – and federalists – who preferred regional, or provincial autonomy.
What if the federalist approach to decentralized water management dominated policy during the establishment of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands?

Rather than a centralized Rijkswaterstaat, all water management would be overseen by local and regional water boards. Each water board would be tasked with balancing risk management and finances.

These spatial scenarios compare two water boards. One with a higher flood risk and a small tax base, eventually leading to the abandonment of the land, turning it into a floodplain. In contrast, an in-land water board, with low risk of flooding and low flood defense costs, offers cheaper land and becomes a new urban center. Decentralized water management across the Netherlands may lead urbanization away from the river.
