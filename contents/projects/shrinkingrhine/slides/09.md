## Title

Through years of water flow dwindling, the river landscape changed what the Maas looked like. The constant seasonal shift of the river courses and sediment deposition formed the alluvial plain. The exposure of the riverbed is now crawling with wild bushes and reeds. Many havens and water-related facilities were either landfilled or rebuilt to accommodate the change in the cityâ€™s function.  The island between Fijenoord and Rotterdam old town was an abandoned natural-artificial hybrid area, occasionally used as a sports exercise for the past twenty years. Although, some plans for incentives in tourism and recreation failed in the end. During the winter of 1951 and spring of 1952, the former island was busy building on the realization of a fairytale forest with 10 moving fairytale scenes.
