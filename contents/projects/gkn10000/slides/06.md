### _v.    Heat Distribution_

A simulation of heat distribution in the cooling water plumbing area provides insight on the gradual shifts in the local ecosystem. Test measurements conducted regularly by RIZA and the Rijkswaterstraat, signified a 1°C rise in median water temperature since 1960. The maximum limit of 28°C was almost reached on several occasions of draught and hot weather, on areas beyond the mixing zone, while GKN proceeded to precautionary temporal cessation of production for 6 days on August of 1976, and for 3 days or less during several other occasions.
