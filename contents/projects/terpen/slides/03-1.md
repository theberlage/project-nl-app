## Reimagining the development of the Biesbosch

A place where they severely experienced the disadvantages of dikes is the Biesbosch. A sequence of three floods (1421-1423), whereof the famous St.-Elizabeth flood, caused a lack of money or fate to repair the band dikes of the ‘Grote Waard’ which in turn caused the formation of an inland sea, which was called ‘The Bergsche Veld’ at the time. Little by little, sedimentation of soil and consolidation by rushes caused marshland to emerge again. As this rebirth of land sparked a renewed interest in cultivating the Biesbosch, it marks an opportunity to re-imagine a historical turn-out of events of the Biesbosch, an alternative history, where terps are chosen over dikes.
