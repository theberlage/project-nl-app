## From Lobith to Nijmegen

From floodplains, to polders, to ports, the landscapes along the Rhine were redeveloped to reestablish a new dynamic water flow within the standardized river bed.

The newly created Bemmelsche Waard enabled the overflow of water in the outer curve of the river. With the alteration of the waterflow in the curves, the Gentsche Waard could be scaled down, with the Erlecomse Polder having a slight increase in its capacity. As the landscapes gradually took over the control over the river, the ports of Nijmegen started to extend towards the areas beneath the Buiten Ambtswaard and Halderse Waard.

Now, with the riversâ€™ role reestablished within the military defense strategy, and the landscape reconfigured, a new military strategy could be embedded in the construction of forts protecting the river.
