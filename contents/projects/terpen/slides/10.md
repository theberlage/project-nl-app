## ‘Terping’ of the Biesbosch

And so we speculate on terps: a combination of government, non-government and private parties with intense negotiation practice make up the body of governance over terps. On the map we can distinguish three agricultural terp-types: The organically grown terp dating from the 16th century, the 19th century conventional circle-shape terps, and the band-terps. Band-terps could be recognized which are terps that grew linear in size over time. This linear growth was implemented as a defence system against the Nieuwe Merwede, and to passively regulate the waterflow in the Biesbosch. With the construction of the 19th century terps, Biesbosch became a place of intensive agricultural mono-culture.
