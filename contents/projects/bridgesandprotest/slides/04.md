## Protests from the Lower Town

The middle class in the lower town, especially the shopkeepers, vehemently opposed the landing of the bridge at Belvédère because they knew that the centre of the city would shift to the upper town area with the completion of the bridge. This would result in the loss of the commercial benefits tied to accessibility. Historically, the lower town did decline after Waalbrug was built, and the decline continued until the plan of riverbank revitalization that began after the 1950s.
