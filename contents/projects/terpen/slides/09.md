##  ‘Terping’ of the Biesbosch

Similarly to polders, terps are controlled by a combination of government, non-government and private parties, which required a great deal of negotiation. The map distinguishes three agricultural terp-types: the organically grown terp dating from the sixteenth century, the nineteenth century conventional circle-shape terps, and the band-terps. Band-terps grew linearly in size over time. This linear growth was implemented as a defense system against the Nieuwe Merwede, and to passively regulate the waterflow in the Biesbosch. With the construction of the 19th century terps, Biesbosch became a place of intensive agricultural mono-culture.
