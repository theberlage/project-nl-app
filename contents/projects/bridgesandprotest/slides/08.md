## Quays for Trade and Recreation

The need for dredging the north side of the Waal would become more urgent due to the urban development of Lent and the fact that the depth of the Waal on the north side would limit the width of the navigation channel, and Lent would take advantage of Third normalisation of the Waal (reduction of main-channel width from 310 to 260 m to improve navigability, 1910-1916) to deepen the north side of the Waal. 

With the increased space utilisation of the river, the urban functions of the river banks on both sides would be differentiated: Lent side would have the opportunity to take on trade and logistics functions, while Nijmegen side would have a more purely recreational function. The increased water capacity in the Waal would also help to prevent flooding in Nijmegen to a certain extent.
