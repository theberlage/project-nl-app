## Wetland-based Agricultural Systems

The first ring, higher and protected against the river, was used for small-scale production of crops and cattle breed, and also served as a storage place of the extracted sources of the second ring. If the second ring was marshland, then reed, rushes or willows were cultivated on a large scale. If the second ring was filled with water, it was used for fish farming.
