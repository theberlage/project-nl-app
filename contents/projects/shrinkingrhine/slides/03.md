## Reluctance to Admit the Inevitable

It is now 1880, marking a decade since the construction of the new island of Noordereiland. The island is artificially formed with hopes of better controlling the limited waterflow, creating more room for ships and separating the desired future construction in Fijenoord from the rest of the city. However, while the city still makes plans for the future growth of the port the inevitable keeps creeping up. The less maintained riverbed around Schiedam is heavily silting up and changing the biodiversity of the landscape. To combat this the city decides to narrow the riverbed even more to create the necessary depth for the transport ships that have already shrunk in size and number. All in all Rotterdam can no longer compete with other European ports and the reluctance for change is the only thing maintaining the status quo.
