## Species Distribution

Due to the artificially warmer water near GKN’s nuclear park, non-indigenous aquatic species would find their way from natural habitats, aquafarming facilities or aquariums across the Rhine, to become integrated in the local condition. The newly established tropical micro-ecosystem would increase the floodplain’s popularity as a recreational destination.
