## The Original Construction plan of de Waalbrug

The vulture ferry had been used to cross the Waal since the 17th century. However, since the beginning of the 20th century, the Waal became increasingly busy and therefore, making it dangerous for the ferry to cross. The growing number of cars and (motor) bicycles increased the waiting times at the ferry. Construction of the bridge could also provide work for the growing number of unemployed in Nijmegen. In 1911, the Ministry of Water Management decided that a new bridge could be built on the edge of Nijmegen, provided that it ended up at the Belvédère that led to the upper town. Historically, this Waalbrug became part of the National Road Program.
