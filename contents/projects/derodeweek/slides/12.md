## Settlement for Shipbuilders

Delineated strips reconcile urbanization, industrialization, and landscape. Connected by a detailed rail system, the workers of the RDM Settlement for Shipbuilders construct a communal and responsible habitat. Through horizontal planning, the settlement will expand into another as a network of industrial clusters redefining the order of the old city and its agglomeration.
