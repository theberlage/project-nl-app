## Title

Throughout the years the shrinking of the rhine curbed and the constant seasonal shift of the river courses and consequent sedimentation formed the alluvial plain. The exposure of the riverbed is now crawling with wild bushes and reeds. Many havens and water-related facilities were either landfilled or rebuilt to accommodate the change in the cityâ€™s function.  The port infrastructure in the Fijenoord was abandoned and soon was completely overgrown with local flora becoming a popular tourist destination for artists, nature enthusiasts and adventure seeking teenagers.
