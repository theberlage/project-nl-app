## Introduction

The Suez Crisis in 1956 sparked national interest in nuclear power as an alternative energy source. When natural gas was discovered in Groningen in 1959, the government and electricity providers lost momentum in the development of nuclear power. Only one nuclear power plant was built along the river.

What if natural gas were never discovered in Groningen? Nuclear energy production would be urgently promoted for national economic and technological independence. The contribution speculates on the landscape engineering processes for large scale nuclear energy production along the river, and on the consequential effects of the artificial and natural equilibrium shifts from current to future ecosystems.
