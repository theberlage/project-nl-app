## Bifurcation Technology

The technology that was presented made use of groynes, often used to control navigability of the river.An advancement of this technology proposed a bifurcation method based on an upscaling of the conventionally applied groyne enabling the control of the waterflow and silting of the river, while maintaining its original bifurcation shape. 

Due to the urgent challenges this revolutionary technology was used for the first time. After selecting a location downstream of Nijmegen, the morphological positioning of the new canal and bifurcation resulted in the specified site near Oosterhout. Remarkably, the precise development of this reproductive technology could result in a reconsideration of the water distribution on a larger scale.
