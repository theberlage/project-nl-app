## From Lobith to Nijmegen

With this bifurcation, a triangular network of trade was established; creating a direct trade route of Nijmegen with the capital city of Amsterdam, while maintaining the connection with the port of Rotterdam. Eventually, this resulted in the abiding growth of the city and port of Nijmegen.
The improved operation of the transportation and trade network enabled Nijmegen, as largest city upstream the Rhine, to undertake the task of transport, transshipment and storage of various resources. Nijmegen had become the main inland shipping port responsible for the distribution of goods on a regional, national and international level.
