## Radioactivity Stays

With the decommission of Dodewaard IV in 2070, GKN stopped generating electricity. Hiesche Floodplain underwent 30 years of further renaturalization.

A LiDAR map captured a moment of movement in the floodplain and of stillness in the sole remaining facility of GKN in 2100. Standing at a height of 26 meters above NAP, DORA ensured the safe containment of the disposed power plants until 2309.
