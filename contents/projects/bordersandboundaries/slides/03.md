## Lekkerland Water Board - 1881

The Nieuw Lekkerlandsche and Streefkerksche Polders had similar beginnings to their neighbors, protecting reclaimed land used for farming. Unable to strike a deal with other polders, they were forced to start their own water board. With an agricultural focus, the water board did not have the population density to properly pay for the upkeep of the extensive band dike within its boundaries.
