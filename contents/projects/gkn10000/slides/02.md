## About GKN DodeWaard

DodeWaard I, commissioned in 1969, facilitated government and corporate investigations on nuclear electricity production. Following its success, Dodewaard II would have been commissioned in 1979, equipped with a similar Boiling Water Reactor(BWR) of greater energy production capacity (912 MW). The adjacent river supplies sufficient water for cooling, produced power is allotted through PGEMâ€™s 150 kV grid, while proximity to Arnhem, where many companies involved with the project are based, is convenient. The low population density in the area continues to meet all safety regulations. With the proven profitability of both power plants, earthworks and river management for future power plants would follow through, despite the anti-nuclear protests in 1980 and 1981. The floodplain would be significantly transformed to ensure adherence to standards of incident/accident prevention.
