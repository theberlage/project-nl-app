The Red Week (De Rode Week) was a failed socialist revolution in the Netherlands in November of 1918 led by the Dutch socialist Pieter Jelles Troelstra. Instead, the Netherlands remained a constitutional monarchy, promoting capitalist growth and commerce.

What if the uprising removed monarchical power and created a socialist state? What would the development of industry, housing, and spatial planning in a socialist Netherlands look like? How would patterns of growth develop in Rotterdamâ€™s port? The contribution speculates on the spatial and ideological implications of a socialist leadership for the port of Rotterdam.
