## First Terp

What if this remaining house on the Sliedrechtse Biesbosch — which was mentioned in a report of 1523 to be an inn — became a mooring point for shippers that searched neutral ground to dock, exchange food and information? Then the inn would have potentially grown in size, enlarged to a settlement, but this time not diked but built on a mound around the 1520s-30s.
