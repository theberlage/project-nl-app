## Wetland-based agricultural systems

The first ring, higher ed and protected against the river, was used for smaller scale productions of crops or cattle breed, and also served as storage place of the extracted sources of the second ring. If the second ring was marshland, then reed, rushes or willows were cultivated on a large scale. If the second ring was a water area, it was used for fish farming.
