## 2012 Renaturalization Plan - GKN for Nature

To amend the environmental impact of the Dodewaard nuclear park, GKN, in cooperation with Rijkswaterstraat, the Municipalities of Nijmegen and Arnhem, and the Boskallis construction company would finalize a renaturalization plan for the Hiensche floodplain and proceed to its implementation. The intervention would be projected to promote the viability of local flora and fauna through a design that would remain non-obstructive to the effective operation of the nuclear power plant complex and, since 2008 and 2009, of the on-site interim and permanent radioactive waste storage facilities.
