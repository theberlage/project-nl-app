## Wetland-based agricultural systems

Terp-settlements had a centre and two rings. The centre and the first ring form a dry plateau. The second ring is not heightened, and so marshland or water was to be found there. The centre, being the highest point, was the public space where all the plots adjoined and was the centre of distribution and organisation. Often, a church can be found there or a water well. A single road would connect the terp with the river. The first ring is radially divided into plots of arable heightened land. The centre and the first ring form a dry plateau. The second ring is not heightened, and so marshland or water was to be found there and the farmers adapted their activities to it.
