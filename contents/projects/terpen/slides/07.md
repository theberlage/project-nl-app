##  Right conditions for large-scale terp planning: Constitution of Thorbecke

Between 1848 and 1874, the right conditions came together for a large-scale mound construction to flourish. First of all, the Constitution in Thorbecke in 1848 caused an ‘economic revolution that revolved around the introduction of new infrastructural networks that forced the local economic actors to compete with entrepreneurs in other cities, for the first time creating an economic space without political and economic barriers. (Wagenaar 2016) The Constitution of Thorbecke created a foundation for liberalism to flourish and strived for a societal framework based on “equality and equal opportunities for all citizens” (Wagenaar 2016). In other words, the state would take a step back from economic matters but would provide a framework to enhance the maximization of profit of private enterprises.
