## Right Conditions for Large-scale Terp Planning: Introduction of the Steam Dredger and the Excavation of the Nieuwe Merwede

The introduction of the Steam dredger in 1824 made it possible to construct large terps. Additionally, it allowed for the excavation of the Nieuwe Merwede canal between 1861 and 1874, which allowed for the construction of large terps in the Biesbosch. The government responsible for the digging of the Nieuwe Merwede, closed a deal with private investors that the soil dredged from the Nieuwe Merwede could be used to construct terps. The government together with the Rijkswaterstaat drew out an overall structure for the terps, in the spirit of the Garden City Utopia. The construction was financed by rich investors that bought up one or more planned terps to resell it when completed to individual farmers. Terps were then named after the benefactors.
