# **De Rode Week**
### _Factories_

The arrangement of the port radiates from the central factor. The machine factory, a key contribution from architect Mart Stam, becomes a beacon of industry and links the ship harbor to the train station. Primary transportation is the train system between the industrial zone and green buffer. From the main artery, auxiliary transportation lines will circulate from the housing settlement, through the buffer zone, to the industrial zone, infrastructural zone and finally the house of industry.
