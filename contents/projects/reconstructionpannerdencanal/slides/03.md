### _ii.    Bifurcation Technology_

The technology that was presented made use of groynes, which were often used to navigate the river. Rather than a technology that made use of conventional groynes; the proposed bifurcation technology made use of a structure of groynes of a larger scale. A revolutionary technology, although carried by many with concerns, which due to the urgent challenges faced was constructed for the first time. Connecting the city of Nijmegen with the capital city of Amsterdam, the distribution point was specified to distribute 40% of the Rhine water in the Oosterhout Canal and 60% in the Waal.
