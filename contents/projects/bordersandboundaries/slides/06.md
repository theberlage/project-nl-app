## Lekkerland Water Board - 1921

Where water boards could not afford to normalize their stretch of river, shipping companies paid for projects that may improve trade routes. To foster relationships with water boards, and to document the river, the shipping company helped pay for many maps. This map was commissioned by both a shipping company and the Lekkerland Water Board.
