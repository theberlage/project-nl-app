## Project NL

River Atlas culminates the fall 2023 incarnation of the Berlage’s long-standing Project NL course organized in collaboration with TU Delft Library and Allmaps. An attempt to understand the river landscapes of the Netherlands—not as givens but rather products of complex sets of decisions, negotiations, aspirations, and at times arbitrary events—it traces broader historical shifts such as the Enlightenment’s effort to engineer nature, moments of hesitation, and gradual aspirations for coexistence.

A range of cartographic documents, archival materials and historical records are used to document spaces, buildings, infrastructure, landscapes, and how these transformed over time. From the first comprehensive cartographic documentation of the Netherlands’s river landscape in the 1830s—led by B. H. Goudriaan—to the late twentieth century “New Style” maps, Dutch river maps were a primary source of investigation. They were studied through the lens of river dynamics and regulation, trade and transportation, extraction and discharge and inhabitation and recreation. Following the dawn of enlightened thought this set of cartography documents—consisting of hundreds of maps informing the trained eye about their historical context, purpose of execution, their patrons and beneficiaries—was the first attempt at measuring, quantifying, and assessing the river in order to start planning into the future. The availability of new digital tools such as Allmaps and Placemark, made it possible to work with these documents. Operations that would have taken an unfeasible amount of time and tedious labor—such as overlaying, duplicating, masking, and juxtaposing these maps in the same physically accurate space—are now possible with the help of these open-source tools.

The exhibition consists of original prints of the river maps from different periods displayed in the freestanding vitrines and speculative histories based on these maps placed within and on top the wall vitrines. Seven narratives each speculate on how a different set of decisions based a specific pivotal point in history could have crystallized in an entirely different yet probable spatial configuration. They look at themes ranging from settlement patterns and unproductive landscapes to national and local infrastructures, drawing links between historical tendencies and the current state of the river landscapes. Together with the original maps and the complementary digital application, they constitute a body of work that explores the relationship between developments in cartographic technology and the material culture of archive material, reflecting on shifts in the accessibility, possibilities of processing, and forms of dissemination of cartographic documents.

This atlas navigates some clues about the types of challenges that may be faced in the near future, and how to identify the complex web of relationships they would be entangled in and the arsenal of tools that may be available for acting on them.

Allmaps is a set of open source tools for curating, georeferencing and exploring digitized maps. It works on the basis of the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF), which is implemented by an increasing number of libraries and archives worldwide in order to share their digital collections. The Allmaps Editor can be used to annotate images with geographic information. Subsequently the map can be loaded in a map interface and compared with other maps in the Allmaps Viewer, without the need for derivatives or additional server infrastructure. The Berlage collaborated with Allmaps on the River Atlas.

_River Atlas will be exhibited in the Department of Architecture corridor, located on the first floor of the TU Delft’s Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment’s eastern wing, from Tuesday, January 31 to Wednesday, March 1._
