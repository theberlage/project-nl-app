## GKN 2309

A LiDAR map would capture a moment of movement in the floodplain and of stillness in the sole remaining facility of GKN. Standing at a height of 26 meters above NAP, DORA will ensure the safe containment of the disposed power plants, which are graded as low and intermediate level waste, until 2309.
