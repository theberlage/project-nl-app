## What Happened in Reality

In reality Pannaden canal was connected to the Rhine in 1701 postponing its silting for centuries. Noordeneiland did not host the Forest Island and Anton Pieck went on to found Efteling together with filmmaker Peter Reijnders. Rotterdam and its port kept growing in size and annexing neighboring municipalities along the way. It would get bombed during the WWll and subsequently rebuilt with Marshall funds further reinforcing its character as a city of ships and cars.
