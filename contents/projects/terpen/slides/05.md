## Emerging Traditional Crafts

As more land appeared, the Biesbosch became an “inland estuary.” Starting in the sixteenth century and peaking in the seventeenth century, regional crafts developed in the area, such as willow, reed, and rush cultivating, fishing, and duck catching. Supported by the estuary, these crafts characterized the area for long after. Two kinds of people were inhabiting the wild nature of Biesbosch. Wandering families sought a new fate in the Biesbosch and established isolated settlements in its marshlands on small mounds, constructing mostly catch pipes for ducks (vangpijpen). Seasonal workers from nearby villages like Werkendam,stayed in wooden cabins (schrankketen) in appalling conditions, cutting the reeds, rushes and pollarding the willows.
