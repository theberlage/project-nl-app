## About GKN DodeWaard

In 1956 floodplain the Hiensche Waard in Dodewaard was chosen as the site for the Dutch first nuclear power plant. The adjacent river supplied sufficient water for cooling, produced power was allotted through PGEMâ€™s 150 kV grid, while proximity to Arnhem, where many companies involved with the project were based, was convenient. 

Dodewaard I, commissioned in 1969, facilitated government and corporate investigations on nuclear electricity production. Following its success, Dodewaard II was commissioned in 1979, equipped with a similar Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) of greater energy production capacity (912 MW). 

Earthworks and river management for future power plants followed through, despite the anti-nuclear protests in 1980 and 1981.
