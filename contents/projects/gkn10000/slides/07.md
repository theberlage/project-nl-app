## Cooling Water Discharge

For Dodewaard II and III supplementary cooling towers were needed. The heated (to a legal maximum of 30Â°C) cooling water was discharged through a water outlet to the Strang.

Dodewaard II used a series of crossflow cooling towers, and dissipated the heat into the atmosphere.
