## The Dike Set back

In order to prevent flooding of urban areas, the Dutch government is promoting a policy of widening floodplains of larger rivers, rather than raising the dikes, which is a departure from the traditional Dutch approach to flood protection.

The Waal along Nijmegen is one of the earliest Room for the River project sites (2012-2016). It involved moving the Waal dike in Lent (northern part of the city) and constructing an ancillary channel in the floodplains, the so called Spiegelwaal (Mirror Waal).

But in the context of this fictional “Waalbrug” scenario, the relocation of the dike in Lent was not possible. An alternative plan needed to be considered by the government after the 1995 flood.
