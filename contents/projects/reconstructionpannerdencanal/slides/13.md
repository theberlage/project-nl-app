## In Reality

In actuality, this did not happen. The French were able to traverse the river at times of war, leaving the Netherlands vulnerable to military advances. The Pannerden Canal was constructed. Even though the Rhine trade cities protested the expansion of the river, they were overruled by the existing trade cities on the Neder Rhine. After this decision, the canal and bifurcation point as shipping routes were set. 

Although the bifurcation point’s necessity is indisputable, this speculative history questions the hasty and nearsighted decision process that led to its construction. 

The construction of the canal resulted in the stagnation of Nijmegen’s growth, while the port of Rotterdam and Amsterdam continued to grow. As the bifurcation of the Pannerden Canal was never questioned, all infrastructure and water works were adjusted to the pre-existing system, originating from the war of 1647. All cities were developed west of the Netherlands, next to the rising sea.
