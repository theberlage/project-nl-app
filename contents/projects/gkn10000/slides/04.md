### _iii.    (De)commissioning_

In 1989, Dodewaard III was officially commissioned, equipped with an advanced 1485 MW Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR). 
In 1997, Dodewaard I was sealed after its decommissioning, to ensure the safe containment. Instead of a forty-year waiting period, the remaining structure would be dismantled until the completion of DORA ( De Dodewaard Organisatie voor Radioactief Afval). 
The Hiesche Floodplain was drastically engineered. River normalization and an integrated intake pool provide sufficient cooling water to the power plants. Pioneer longitudinal dams replaced groynes to keep the river flow and prevent erosion. 
1997 marked the end of the river map production.
