## First Terp

On a 16th century map, on a small remaining island north of the Groote Waard, a “survivor” of the devastating 1421 St. Elizabeth flood is found. The only sign of human life in the newly formed inland sea, dating from 1523. The remaining house on the Sliedrechtse Biesbosch — which was mentioned in a report of 1523 to be an inn — became a mooring point for shippers that searched neutral ground to dock, exchange food and information? Then the inn would have potentially grown in size, enlarged to a settlement, built on a mound around the 1520s-30s.
